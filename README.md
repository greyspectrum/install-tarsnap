#install-tarsnap
Fetch, verify, and build Tarsnap. For Debian and Debian-derived distros, only.

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS amd64.

*Note: if you are installing Tarsnap on a server, rather than a machine with a desktop environment, then just comment out the* `xdg-open` *command at line number 97. This line opens the system's default browser and loads the Tarnsap account registration page, but this naturally won't work if your machine has no browser.*
